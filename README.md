# Just a photo carousel

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I was wondering how photo carousels are built, so I tried... t'was OK.\
All photos are cruelty-free, feel-good vegan photos. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
That's if you dowload it.
